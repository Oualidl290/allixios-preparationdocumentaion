## 🎯 Design Principles

- **Microservices First**: Each service is independently deployable
- **API-Driven**: All interactions through well-defined APIs
- **Event-Driven**: Asynchronous communication via message queues
- **Cloud-Native**: Designed for Kubernetes and cloud platforms
- **Security by Design**: Zero-trust security model
- **Observability**: Comprehensive monitoring and tracing
