# 🔧 Column "tablename" Does Not Exist - FIXED

## ✅ Issue Resolved

**Error**: `column "tablename" does not exist`  
**Location**: Line 272 in index monitoring view  
**Cause**: Incorrect column reference in `pg_stat_user_indexes`

## 🛠️ What Was Fixed

### Before (Broken)
```sql
CREATE OR REPLACE VIEW public.index_usage_stats AS
SELECT 
    schemaname,
    tablename,        -- ❌ This column doesn't exist
    indexname,        -- ❌ This column doesn't exist
    ...
FROM pg_stat_user_indexes 
```

### After (Fixed)
```sql
CREATE OR REPLACE VIEW public.index_usage_stats AS
SELECT 
    s.schemaname,
    s.relname as tablename,        -- ✅ Correct column name
    s.indexrelname as indexname,   -- ✅ Correct column name
    ...
FROM pg_stat_user_indexes s
```

## 📁 Files Fixed

All index files have been updated:
- ✅ `core/database/optimization/supabase-indexes.sql`
- ✅ `core/database/optimization/performance-indexes-safe.sql`  
- ✅ `core/database/optimization/performance-indexes.sql`

## 🚀 Ready to Deploy

The indexes will now create successfully:

```bash
# Deploy with fixed index monitoring view
npm run deploy:indexes

# Test the view works correctly
npm run test:indexes

# Monitor index usage (now works!)
npm run monitor:indexes
```

## ✅ Expected Results

After deployment:
```
✅ 50+ indexes created successfully
✅ Index monitoring view created without errors
✅ Can query index usage statistics
✅ No column reference errors
```

## 🔍 Verification

Test that the fix worked:

```bash
# Test the index view
npm run test:indexes

# Should show output like:
# test_name: View creation test | result: PASSED
# index_count: [number of indexes]
# message: Index usage view test completed successfully
```

## 📊 Monitor Index Performance

Now you can monitor your indexes:

```bash
# View index usage statistics
npm run monitor:indexes

# Expected columns:
# - schemaname: public
# - tablename: articles, users, etc.
# - indexname: idx_articles_slug, etc.
# - usage_category: High Usage, Medium Usage, etc.
# - index_size: 1024 kB, etc.
```

## 🎯 What This Enables

With the fixed monitoring view, you can:
- ✅ **Track index usage** and identify unused indexes
- ✅ **Monitor performance** and optimize queries
- ✅ **Identify bottlenecks** in database operations
