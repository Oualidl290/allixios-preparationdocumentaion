# Enterprise Allixios Platform Architecture Requirements

## Introduction

This specification defines the requirements for transforming the current Allixios content management platform into a world-class, enterprise-grade system that can scale to handle millions of articles, thousands of concurrent users, and generate significant revenue through intelligent automation and AI-powered content operations.

The system must evolve from its current database-first architecture to a comprehensive microservices platform that maintains the performance benefits of the PostgreSQL foundation while adding enterprise capabilities for scalability, reliability, and advanced AI integration.

## Requirements

3. WHEN content quality scoring is performed THEN the system SHALL use ensemble methods combining multiple quality metrics
4. WHEN AI costs exceed thresholds THEN the system SHALL implement automatic cost controls and budget management
5. IF AI model performance degrades THEN the system SHALL automatically adjust model selection algorithms
6. WHEN fine-tuning is available THEN the system SHALL continuously improve model performance using feedback data
7. WHEN content personalization is needed THEN the system SHALL use user behavior data to customize content generation

### Requirement 5: Enterprise Security & Compliance

**User Story:** As a security officer, I want comprehensive security controls including encryption, access management, audit logging, and compliance features, so that the platform meets enterprise security standards and regulatory requirements.

2. WHEN data is transmitted THEN all communications SHALL use TLS 1.3 or higher encryption
3. WHEN users access the system THEN they SHALL authenticate using multi-factor authentication
4. WHEN API access is granted THEN it SHALL use JWT tokens with configurable expiration and refresh mechanisms
5. IF unauthorized access is attempted THEN the system SHALL log the attempt and trigger security alerts
6. WHEN audit trails are required THEN the system SHALL maintain comprehensive logs of all user actions and system events
7. WHEN compliance reporting is needed THEN the system SHALL generate GDPR, SOC2, and other regulatory compliance reports

### Requirement 6: Real-Time Analytics & Monitoring

**User Story:** As a business intelligence analyst, I want real-time analytics dashboards with predictive insights and automated alerting, so that we can monitor system performance, content effectiveness, and business metrics in real-time.
