# Security Hardening Requirements Document

## Introduction

This specification addresses critical security vulnerabilities identified in the Allixios CMS Supabase database through comprehensive security hardening. The platform currently has excellent architecture and functionality but requires immediate security improvements to meet enterprise security standards and compliance requirements.

The security audit revealed 8 tables without RLS protection, 27 tables with RLS enabled but no policies, 70+ functions with security issues, and several other critical vulnerabilities that expose sensitive data including user information, financial metrics, and system operations data.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Row Level Security (RLS) Implementation

**User Story:** As a platform administrator, I want comprehensive Row Level Security implemented across all database tables, so that user data is properly isolated and protected from unauthorized access.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN accessing any public table THEN the system SHALL enforce Row Level Security policies
2. WHEN a user queries revenue_metrics THEN the system SHALL only return data they are authorized to view
3. WHEN accessing performance_intelligence_cache THEN the system SHALL apply appropriate access controls
4. WHEN querying n8n execution tables THEN the system SHALL restrict access based on user roles
5. WHEN accessing api_rate_limits THEN the system SHALL enforce user-specific visibility
6. WHEN querying articles table THEN the system SHALL apply content ownership policies
7. WHEN accessing users table THEN the system SHALL enforce user privacy policies
8. WHEN querying categories table THEN the system SHALL apply appropriate visibility rules

### Requirement 2: Database Function Security Hardening

**User Story:** As a security administrator, I want all database functions to have secure search paths and proper security contexts, so that functions cannot be exploited for privilege escalation or RLS bypass.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN any database function executes THEN the system SHALL use a fixed, secure search path
2. WHEN security definer functions run THEN the system SHALL not bypass RLS policies inappropriately
3. WHEN functions access sensitive data THEN the system SHALL enforce proper authorization checks
4. WHEN get_system_health_realtime() executes THEN the system SHALL use secure search path settings
5. WHEN n8n_workflow_performance view is accessed THEN the system SHALL apply proper security controls
6. WHEN api_usage_summary view is queried THEN the system SHALL enforce appropriate access restrictions

### Requirement 3: Extension and Schema Security

**User Story:** As a database administrator, I want database extensions properly isolated in dedicated schemas, so that they cannot interfere with application security or be exploited by unauthorized users.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the vector extension is accessed THEN the system SHALL locate it in the extensions schema
2. WHEN pg_trgm extension is used THEN the system SHALL access it from the extensions schema
3. WHEN application code references extensions THEN the system SHALL use proper schema-qualified names
4. WHEN new extensions are installed THEN the system SHALL place them in the extensions schema by default

### Requirement 4: Materialized View Security

**User Story:** As a data protection officer, I want materialized views containing sensitive data to be properly secured, so that aggregated data cannot be accessed without proper authorization.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN popular_articles materialized view is accessed THEN the system SHALL enforce appropriate access controls
2. WHEN article_performance materialized view is queried THEN the system SHALL apply user-specific filtering
3. WHEN materialized views are refreshed THEN the system SHALL maintain security constraints
4. WHEN API access occurs to materialized views THEN the system SHALL enforce RLS policies

### Requirement 5: Authentication and Authorization Hardening

**User Story:** As a security administrator, I want authentication settings optimized for security, so that user accounts are protected against common attack vectors.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN OTP tokens are generated THEN the system SHALL set expiry to maximum 15 minutes
2. WHEN users authenticate THEN the system SHALL enforce appropriate session timeouts
3. WHEN API keys are used THEN the system SHALL validate proper authorization levels
4. WHEN admin functions are accessed THEN the system SHALL require elevated authentication

### Requirement 6: Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)

**User Story:** As a platform administrator, I want comprehensive role-based access control implemented, so that users can only access data and functions appropriate to their role level.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a reader role user accesses data THEN the system SHALL only allow read access to public content
2. WHEN an author role user manages content THEN the system SHALL only allow access to their own content
3. WHEN an editor role user reviews content THEN the system SHALL allow access to content in their assigned categories
4. WHEN an admin role user accesses system functions THEN the system SHALL allow full administrative access
5. WHEN role assignments change THEN the system SHALL immediately update access permissions

### Requirement 7: Audit Logging and Monitoring

**User Story:** As a compliance officer, I want comprehensive audit logging of all security-related events, so that we can track access patterns and detect potential security breaches.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN RLS policies are bypassed or fail THEN the system SHALL log the security event
2. WHEN sensitive data is accessed THEN the system SHALL record audit trail information
3. WHEN administrative functions are executed THEN the system SHALL log the action and user
4. WHEN security violations are detected THEN the system SHALL generate appropriate alerts
5. WHEN audit logs are queried THEN the system SHALL enforce proper access controls

### Requirement 8: Data Encryption and Protection

**User Story:** As a data protection officer, I want sensitive data fields properly encrypted at rest and in transit, so that confidential information is protected even if database access is compromised.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN revenue data is stored THEN the system SHALL encrypt sensitive financial information
2. WHEN user personal information is saved THEN the system SHALL apply appropriate encryption
3. WHEN API keys are stored THEN the system SHALL use secure encryption methods
4. WHEN encrypted data is queried THEN the system SHALL decrypt only for authorized users
5. WHEN data is transmitted THEN the system SHALL enforce TLS encryption

### Requirement 9: Security Testing and Validation

**User Story:** As a quality assurance engineer, I want comprehensive security testing procedures, so that all security implementations can be validated and verified before deployment.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN RLS policies are implemented THEN the system SHALL pass comprehensive access control tests
2. WHEN function security is hardened THEN the system SHALL pass privilege escalation tests
3. WHEN role-based access is configured THEN the system SHALL pass authorization boundary tests
4. WHEN security configurations are deployed THEN the system SHALL pass penetration testing scenarios
5. WHEN audit logging is active THEN the system SHALL pass compliance verification tests

### Requirement 10: Security Documentation and Procedures

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want comprehensive security documentation and procedures, so that security configurations can be maintained and updated properly over time.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN security policies are implemented THEN the system SHALL include complete documentation
2. WHEN security incidents occur THEN the system SHALL provide clear response procedures
3. WHEN security updates are needed THEN the system SHALL include step-by-step upgrade guides
4. WHEN new team members join THEN the system SHALL provide security training materials
5. WHEN compliance audits occur THEN the system SHALL provide complete security documentation
